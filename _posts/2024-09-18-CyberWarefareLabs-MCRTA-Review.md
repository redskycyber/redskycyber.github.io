## Pricing

For just **$49 USD**, this certification is an excellent value. It’s far more affordable than most other certifications, making it a great entry point into cloud red teaming. **CWL** offers this course at a discounted price to give learners access to their platform, hoping they’ll return for more.

## My Overall Experience

I really enjoyed stepping back and diving into this beginner-level multi-cloud course. I haven’t had nearly as much experience with **GCP** and **Azure** compared to **AWS**, so it was great to get familiarized with their authentication mechanisms and learn how to enumerate services across different cloud environments. I’ll admit, I’ve stuck with AWS because it’s where I feel most comfortable and where I’ve chosen to focus my expertise. In doing so, I’ve overlooked the others. This course gave me a chance to explore **GCP** and **Azure** and experience their unique aspects. For anyone just starting out in cloud security and trying to decide where to focus their time, I think this cert is an excellent first step to get hands-on with all three major cloud providers and see which one resonates with them.
