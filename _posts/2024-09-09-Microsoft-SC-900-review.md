**Exam length:** 45 minutes

The exam includes 50 multiple-choice questions to test your knowledge in the below areas. The questions are distributed by the following four areas:

- 25% - Describe the concepts of security, compliance, and identity
- 25% - Describe the capabilities of Microsoft Entra
- 25% - Describe the capabilities of Microsoft security solutions
- 25% - Describe the capabilities of Microsoft compliance solutions

Microsoft offers **FREE** exam practice tests in the same format as the exam with rotating questions providing a great way to train for the exam. I highly recommend and encourage those that complete the course to run through the practice tests at least a few times to get comfortable with the style of questions. During the practice tests, you can choose “Check your Answer” for a short description of why the answer is correct.

You must achieve a score of at least 700 out of 1000 to pass the course. Each question (50 total) is about 20 points each and Microsoft does not disclose if any of the exam focus areas in particular are weighted differently.

## Course and Exam Experience

The Microsoft SC-900 course and exam offer a comprehensive learning experience for those seeking foundational knowledge in Microsoft’s security, compliance, and identity solutions. After approximately 8-10 hours of following the course’s structured learning path and an additional 5-6 hours of practice tests, candidates can feel well-prepared for the exam. The course material is easy to follow, and the practice exams are designed to streamline the learning process, reinforcing the knowledge needed to succeed during the exam.

The majority of the exam questions are closely aligned with the content covered in the practice tests, providing a solid preview of what to expect. However, some questions may require test-takers to apply specific reasoning based on the skills and capabilities introduced in the training modules. While this information may not always be explicitly outlined in the course content, it underscores the advantage of having general IT or cybersecurity experience to navigate these more complex questions.

This course is highly recommended for individuals in IT, cybersecurity, or business roles who are curious about or interested in learning more about Microsoft’s security, identity, and compliance solutions. The SC-900 certification is an excellent starting point for building a solid foundation in cybersecurity expertise.

## Tips and Tricks for Success

> - [x] Take the practice exams provided by Microsoft until you can consistently score 95% or greater. That will be a great indicator that you are ready to pass the exam. 
> - [x] On exam day, make sure your desk area is prepped and you have performed a “system check” if you are taking a proctored exam remotely through PearsonVue. There are specific requirements, such as only using one screen (any additional monitors unplugged), staying in your seat while being recorded, removing all items from your desk, and submitting pictures of your testing room from all angles.
> - [x] The practice exam results show topic areas for questions that you answer incorrectly. If there is a specific area where you continue to score low, Microsoft will recommend specific modules to brush up your knowledge on the specific questions that you may have missed. You should take advantage of this so that you can close any knowledge gaps and will dramatically improve your exam score potential.
